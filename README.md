# taskManagement
This program is designed for task management purposes.
(However, it is only a rudimentary desktop application due to server rental and other reasons.)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

In its initial conception, it was designed as a desktop application to notify periodic tasks.
If a server is not used, database and other settings are required.
Due to time constraints, we decided to stop once at the rudimentary application stage, as this was the first time to manufacture using python.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The functionality consists of three components: home screen, task management screen, and assignment management screen.

【First: Home screen】
You can view the values entered on the Task Management screen and Allocation Management screen.
The number of displayed values is based on the values in the drop-down list selected on the task management screen.
If nothing is entered on the Task Management screen or Allocation Management screen, the message "Not is set..." will appear. will be displayed.
The date at the top of the screen is a dummy.

【Second: Task Management screen】
You can set the number of tasks and a name for each task.
Clicking the "confirm" button at the bottom of the screen will reflect the settings on the Home screen and the Allocation Management screen.

【Third: Assignment Management Screen】
Allocation can be set for each set task.
The number of tasks is based on the number selected on the Task Management screen.
In the initial screen, "Not yet any tasks..." is displayed. is displayed on the initial screen.

【Impressions】
My first impression of creating an application in python was that the GUI is very difficult to set up.
ASP.NET MVC5, which I had many chances to touch, uses html, css, and Javascript for production, so I realized how different it is from other applications.
If I have time, I would like to add a function to manage it in conjunction with a database and a function to periodically post messages to the Teams chat.
I would also like to touch on web application development using Django.
